# Foundit

This project is created as part of a school assignment for Cloud Application Development to design a lost-and-found web application.

## About this repository
This repository is a monorepo consisting of:
- foundit-rest-api: NodeJS REST API + MongoDB
- foundit-ui: ReactJS Frontend

### foundit-rest-api
1. Create an `.env` file containing the appropriate configurations for your environment. You may refer to `app/config/index.js` for a reference for environment variables.
2. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run start` to bring up the REST API service.

Alternative, you may choose to use the service in a Docker container. (Refer to the package section of the repository if you wish to pull directly without building)
If you wish to build the REST API service from source:
1. Run `npm run build:docker-image` to create a new Docker image.
2. Start a Docker container with the image. Remember to pass in your environment file.

### foundit-ui
1. Start the UI by running `npm start`.
2. (If it doesn't automatically do it for you) Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

To build a production build of the UI:
1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Deploy the `/build` folder to your preferred website hosting service or S3 bucket.
